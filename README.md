# eurorack_smt_file
files for SMT factory manufacturing of eurorack modules.

All files can be submitted directly to the PCB factory for production and have been verified (***because the package library is not uniform, the direction of the coordinate file may have problems, please be sure to check the component direction before production!***)

I use JLC(https://www.jlc.com) as the PCB and SMT manufacturer, all the bill of materials have been corresponding to the JLC component number; so you do not need to match the materials one by one.

# file description:
1. gerber.zip - The gerber file is a PCB manufacturing file that can be submitted directly to production without modification.
2. pnp.csv - Component coordinate files for SMT, in JLC compatible format, can be submitted directly to the factory for production, ***please make sure to adjust the component direction.***
3. bom.csv - Bill of materials for SMT in JLC compatible format that can be submitted directly to the factory for production.
